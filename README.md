Monte Carlo simulation for portfolio risk using historical market data
# Monte Carlo Portfolio Risk Analysis

## Motivation
We study portfolio risk using Monte Carlo simulation based on historical market data.

## Data
Daily adjusted close prices of IBM, GOOG and Silver (Yahoo Finance).

## Methodology
- Compute log-returns
- Estimate mean and volatility
- Simulate future returns using Monte Carlo
- Construct portfolio distribution
- Compute VaR and CVaR

## Results
Monte Carlo simulations show heavy tails and significant downside risk during stress periods.

## Technologies
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

## Future Work
Extend to stochastic volatility models.
